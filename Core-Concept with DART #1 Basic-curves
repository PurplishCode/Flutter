// To get started writing Dart syntax. We'll have to write the main function of it. Otherwise our code won't compile anywhere.

// Our main function, Think of it as the grand entrace for code-manipulation while also the ones providing us the ability to debug our code.. It's like Java's main class.

// void means that THIS function cannot RETURN any value (If invoked with the return statement).

// DART programming languages is statically typed. So we'll have to declare that certain variable with its datatype.

void main() {
  call(
      "Yeah"); // Code will execute as Hello, Yeah! (It'll display 'Yeah' since we pass it as an arguments to call() function)

  int sum = add(4,
      3); // Within the add() function, we pass in int value (Which is already set in the add() function itself) to return x + y (x,y is a parameters. Think of it like a placeholder for passing an arguments.)

  // Then we encapsulate the result of our add() function [The result is 7] into sum variable, and finally we invoke it using text interpolation. (Notice how we uses '' rather than ` ?)
  print("Here's your result $sum");

  String name = greet("Darell");

  print("Hello $name");
}

call(String name) {
  print("Hello, $name!");
}

// Here add function holds two parameters with both integer datatype. It's reserved ONLY for passed-in integer arguments.
int add(int x, int y) {
  return x * y;
}

String greet(String username) {
  return username;
}
